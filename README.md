# SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM

A simple yet effective speech-to-text system built using Python. It supports two methods of recognition:
- Google Web Speech API (online)
- Wav2Vec2 (offline) using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face

This allows users to compare cloud-based and local transcription performance on audio inputs.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts WAV audio files as input
- Transcribes using Google‚Äôs Web API for quick online recognition
- Uses Wav2Vec2 for offline transcription using deep learning
- Handles different sample rates automatically
- Easy to switch between recognition methods

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1. **Google Method**:  
   Loads the WAV file using `speech_recognition`, sends it to Google‚Äôs servers, and prints the returned transcript.

2. **Wav2Vec2 Method**:  
   Loads the same file, resamples if needed, and passes it through the Wav2Vec2 model for local prediction.

Both methods are implemented in simple Python functions for clarity and reusability.
